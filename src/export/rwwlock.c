// This proves that McMini behaves as an emulator:
// A user can link this code into the target application.  We don't even need
// to define an implementation for when the target calls the functions here.
// McMini already models these functions as desired, and will continue
// to block or unblock threads according to a spec analogous to rwlock
// for POSIX.  Since McMini has the semantics correct, it will just work!
