     * arbitrary state in the current DFS search. It is important
     * that the state(s) of the visible object(s) McMini 
     * manages reflect what they were at a particular moment in
     * time during the state-space search since a transition's
     * status for being enabled can change between state changes
     * (consider e.g. a mutex lock becoming disabled after a different
     * thread acquires the mutex before this thread does).
     * 
     * Since DPOR performs stateless model checking, McMini can only
     * represent a *single* state at any given time. Thus, we can either
     * 
     * A. Re-generate the past states of objects by reseting the current
     * state and re-playing the transitions in the transition stack
     * leading up to that state; or
     * B. Compute which threads were enabled when the state was
     * encountered and store them for later use
     * 
     * The former is very expensive and would complicate McMini's 
     * implementation even further. Thus, we opt for the latter choice.
