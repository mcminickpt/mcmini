Version 1.2.0 release notes (DATE: TBD)
==========================================
* Check for recursive pthread_mutex_lock by a thread already holding that mutex lock.

Version 1.1.0 release notes (Oct. 7, 2025)
==========================================

* Data race support (READ/WRITE) added by creating an LLVM plugin to instrument, in the target program, reads and writes to global variable.
* Experimental livelock support added. NOTE: Currently, this identifies livelock examples in which some other enabled threads do not participate.
* max-transitions-depth-limit (Maximum number of transitions any single trace can execute) is supported in addition to max-transitions-depth-limit
* New flags for the mcmini command (and some flags renamed). See the following (extracted from 'mcmini --help').

-M , --max-transitions-depth-limit (default num = 1500)
  Maximum number of transitions any single trace can execute.

-a, --all, --all-deadlocks

-l, --check-for-livelock (experimental)
  Along with deadlocks, also check for livelock. (PROBLEM: Currently, this identifies livelock examples in which some other enabled threads do not participate.)
