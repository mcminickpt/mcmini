  /**
   * @brief Run this model-checking algorithm using coordinator _coordinator_.
   *
   * To verify the correctness of a program using explicit-state model checking,
   * any verification algorithm must investigate all possible states of that
   * program. Each particular state of the program is represented in McMini by
   * an instance `model::state`. A state plus the collection of
   * transitions which are defined at that state is captured in a
   * `model::program`.
   *
   * The `model::program` conceptually represents the "history" of
   * changes that some process underwent. The process whose states are described
   * by the program is represented `real_world::process`.
   *
   * @param coordinator the coordinator which manages the syncrhonization of the
   * program and the processes which those programs represent.
   * @param callbacks a set of functions which are invoked as verification takes
   * place. The callbacks will be invoked when the algorithm encounters the
   * following violations:
   *
   * - when a state _s_ is encountered that is in _deadlock_.(i.e. there is no
   * way to make any more progress). Formally, this means there are no enabled
   * transitions at state _s_.
   * - when a state _s_ has a data race.
   * - if, at any point during verification, one of the corresponding processes
   * crashes.
