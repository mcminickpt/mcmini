/**
 * @brief A function over states of a program.
 *
 * We give the formal definition of a transition from Rodriguez et al. 2018
 * UDPOR
 *
 * """
 * A system is a tuple M <`Σ, T, S_0> formed by a set Σ of global states, a set
 * T of transitions and some initial global state ˜ s > Σ. Each transition t:
 * Σ --> Σ in T is a partial function accounting for how the occurrence of t
 * transforms the state of M. A transition t > T is enabled at a state s if t(s)
 * is defined. Such t can fire at s, producing a new state s'. We let
 * enabled(s) denote the set of transitions enabled at s.
 * """
 *
 * The formal definition clarifies that a transition is _enabled_ at some state
 * `s` iff t(s) is defined at the state. The implementation takes a slightly
 * different approach:
 *
 * - a transition in McMini _may be defined_ in a state `s` but may be
 * _disabled_ in that state; that is, McMini distinguishes between a transition
 * which _cannot exist_ in a given state (e.g. a pthread_mutex_lock() on some
 * mutex which isn't present) and that which _should not exist_ formally but
 * needs to exist to describe a transition. Such a transition is said to
 * _exist_ at that state, even if it is not technically enabled there. Only a
 * subset of all transitions that _exist_ at a state `s` are actually enabled
 * there (with at most one transition per thread).
 *
 * Formally, if a transition is defined in a state `s`, it means it's enabled
 * there according to the formal definition. However, the definition of
 * `model::transition` allows the transition to produce a state _even if
 * the process which is set to execute the transition isn't truly in a position
 * where the transition is being executed_. Transitions perform _look ups_ on
 * the particular state they are given.
 *
 * For example, consider a transition "post(sem)" which takes a visible object
 * (a semaphore) with id `sem` as an argument. The sempahore `sem` may exist in
 * several states, say `s_1, s_2, and s_3`. Suppose thread 1 executes
 * "post(m)" and brings the concurrent system from state `s_1` to `s_2`, and
 * suppose that in state `s_2` thread 1 executes "wait(sem)". In state `s_2`,
 * the transition "thread 1 executes post(sem)" is _not_ enabled since thread 1
 * is _not_ executing a `post(sem)`. However, the implementation of "thread 1
 * executes post(sem)"  _would be defined_ in state `s_2`. In other words, a
 * `model::state` _excludes_ the state of the _processes_; that is the
 * responsibility of `model::program` to ensure that this transition is indeed
 * the next one for the process running it.
 *
 * @note Our definition of transition is more in line with Abdulla et al. 2017,
 * viz. one in which we assume a program is a collection of processes each of
 * which can be represented as partial functions executing atomically;
 * therefore, every transition in McMini is executed by _some_ runner, even if
 * the runner itself is virtual (e.g. a transition that affects multiple
 * threads).

   * @brief Attempts to produce a state _s'_ from state _s_ through the
   * application of this transition function on argument _s_
   *
   * Recall that a transition is merely a function over the states of a
   * concurrent system. Recall further that a transition is only a _partial_
   * function: it need not be defined in all states of the concurrent system.
   * This method thus returns
   *
   * @param s the state to pass as an argument to the transition.
   * @returns the resulting state _s'_ that would be produced if this transition
   * were applied to state _s_ if such a transition is defined at _s_, along
   * with the enabledness of the given transition. If the transition is not
   * defined, a `diff_state` with base `s` is returned, but no other
   * modifications are made to the base.
   * @note a pair is NOT redundant here: it's possible for a transition to be
   * enabled at state `s` but have no effect on it. Hence, we _cannot_ simply
   * rely on the fact that the `diff_state` has changed w.r.t its base to
   * determine enabledness; instead, we must return both the `diff_state` AND
   * the enabled status.
   * @note construction of a new `diff_state` in the `else` branch ensures that
   * partial modifications to `s` are not transferred out of the call to
   * the method into the resulting `diff_state`. Some parts of the transition
   * may have modified the state, and only then would the transition have
   * determined it is no longer enabled. This would be discouraged, but it's
   * possible, so we opt for the defensive stance.
   * @note the `diff_state` that is returned retains the reference to the state
   * `s` supplied to this function. In other words, the state with respect to
   * which the diff is defined is `s`. Keep this in mind if you plan to store
   * the `diff_state` or continue using it after calling this function.
