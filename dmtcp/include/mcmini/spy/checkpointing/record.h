/**
 * @brief Describes the different behaviors that `libmcmini.so` should exhibit
 *
 * `libmcmini.so` is pre-loaded (i.e. with LD_PRELOAD) either directly by the
 * `mcmini` process or by `dmtcp_launch` into an executable known as the
 * _target_. The target is the program whose behavior we wish to verify.
 *
 * `libmcmini.so` however will appear within different processes running the
 * target program and must behave differently based on how and when it was
 * loaded. Below is a description on the different ways `libmcmini.so` can
 * behave.
 *
 * I. Classic Model Checking (No Deep Debugging)
 *
 * TARGET_TEMPLATE:
 *   In this mode, `libmcmini.so` enters an infinite loop waiting for the signal
 *   from the `mcmini` process to produce a new branch via `fork()`.
 *
 * TARGET_BRANCH:
 *   In this mode, `libmcmini.so` will now behave as if under the control of the
 * model checker in the `mcmini` process.
 *
 * II. Recording
 *
 * PRE_DMTCP_INIT:
 *    In this mode, the `mcmini` process has `exec()`-ed into `dmtcp_launch`
 * with `libmcmini.so` as a DMTCP plugin. Here, DMTCP will preload mcmini. Prior
 * to DMTCP sending the `DMTCP_EVENT_INIT` to `libmcmini.so`, wrapper functions
 * simply forward calls to `libpthread.so`
 *
 * PRE_CHECKPOINT_THREAD:
 *   In this mode, DMTCP has sent the `DMTCP_EVENT_INIT` event but has not
 * yet created the checkpoint thread. All wrappers (except `pthread_create`)
 * behave as in `PRE_DMTCP_INIT`. For `pthread_create`, the call is _only_
 * forwarded into DMTCP instead -- the checkpoint thread is NOT recorded.
 *
 * RECORD:
 *   In this mode, `libmcmini.so` performs a light-weight recording of the
 * primitives it encounters and keeps track of their state. Only after doing so
 * do wrapper functions forward calls to the next available function found by
 * `dlsym(3)` using `RTLD_NEXT`.
 *
 * PRE_CHECKPOINT:
 *   In this mode, `libmcmini.so` has been alerted about the end of the
 * recording session. Wrapper functions again forward their calls to the next
 * available function. Wrappers may eventually change their behavior from RECORD
 * mode if necessary.
 *
 * II.i. Deep Debugging with `dmtcp_restart`
 *
 * DMTCP_RESTART_INTO_BRANCH:
 *   In this mode, the DMTCP plugin has been notified of the
 *   `DMTCP_EVENT_RESTART` event. The user-space threads will transition into a
 *   stable state before the template thread and the scheduler process proceed
 *   with model checking. The userspace threads assume that they are immediately
 * under the control of the model checker.
 *
 * II.i. Deep Debugging with `dmtcp_restart`
 *
 * DMTCP_RESTART_INTO_TEMPLATE:
 *   In this mode, the DMTCP plugin has been notified of the
 *   `DMTCP_EVENT_RESTART` event. The user-space threads will transition into a
 *   stable state before the template thread and the scheduler process proceed
 *   with model checking. However, unlike `DMTCP_RESTART_INTO_BRANCH`, the
 * userspace threads assume that they are in a template _process_. The template
 * thread in this template process will repeatedly call `multithreaded_fork()`.
 *
 * TARGET_TEMPLATE_AFTER_RESTART:
 *   In this mode, `libmcmini.so` has been restored by `dmtcp_launch` from a
 *   checkpoint image. Here, `libmcmini.so` will first attempt to communicate
 * with `mcmini` and transfer over the state information recorded during the
 * RECORD phase. After transfer has completed, `libmcmini.so` will behave the
 * same as `TARGET_TEMPLATE`, except this time the template thread will call
 * `multithreaded_fork()` instead of `fork()`. Other userspace threads in the
 * template process are blocked indefinitely and will not communicate with the
 * model checker `mcmini`. Only after a `multithreaded_fork()` will the
 * (duplicates of) these threads participate in model checking.
 *
 * III. Deep Debugging Under the Modeler
 *
 * TARGET_BRANCH_AFTER_RESTART:
 *   In this mode, `libmcmini.so` behaves exactly as in the classic case of
 * `TARGET_BRANCH`. The only difference is that the userspace threads appear
 * after a `dmtcp_restart` of a program in the middle of execution instead
 * directly launching the program. Userspace threads assume they are under the
 * control of the model checker.

 * possible that a user-space thread owned the lock at checkpoint-time (and
 * hence is also the owner at restart-time). If the checkpoint thread then tried
 * to acquire the lock, we'd have deadlock.
