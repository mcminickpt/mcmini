/**
 * @brief Describes the different behaviors that `libmcmini.so` should exhibit
 *
 * `libmcmini.so` is pre-loaded (i.e. with LD_PRELOAD) either directly by the
 * `mcmini` process or by `dmtcp_launch` into an executable known as the
 * _target_. The target is the program whose behavior we wish to verify.
 *
 * `libmcmini.so` however will appear within different processes running the
 * target program and must behave differently based on how and when it was
 * loaded. Below is a description on the different ways `libmcmini.so` can
 * behave.
 *
 * TARGET_TEMPLATE:
 *   In this mode, the `mcmini` `fork()/exec()`-ed a new process (the template)
 *   running the target program with `libmcmini.so` preloaded. In this mode,
 *   `mcmini` expects to be able to repeatedly signal this process when the
 * model checker wants to explore a new branch of the state space.
 * `libmcmini.so` enters an infinite loop waiting for the signal to `fork()`.
 * Wrapper functions simply forward calls to the next available function found
 * by `dlsym(3)` using `RTLD_NEXT`.
 *
 * TARGET_BRANCH:
 *   In this mode, `mcmini` has signaled the template process and expects a new
 * process to be created. In this process, the wrapper functions in
 * `libmcmini.so` will now behave as if under the control of the model checker
 * in `mcmini`.
 *
 * PRE_DMTCP_INIT:
 *   In this mode, the `mcmini` process has `exec()`-ed into `dmtcp_launch` with
 * `libmcmini.so` as a DMTCP plugin. Here, DMTCP will preload mcmini. Prior to
 * DMTCP alerting us with the `DMTCP_EVENT_INIT`, wrapper functions simply
 * forward calls to `libpthread.so`
 *
 * PRE_CHECKPOINT_THREAD:
 *   In this mode, DMTCP has sent the `DMTCP_EVENT_INIT` event but has not
 * yet created the checkpoint thread. All wrappers (except `pthread_create`)
 * behave as in `PRE_DMTCP_INIT`. For `pthread_create`, the call is _only_ forwarded
 * into DMTCP instead -- the checkpoint thread is NOT recorded.
 *
 * RECORD:
 *   In this mode, `libmcmini.so` performs a light-weight recording of the
 * primitives it encounters and keeps track of their state. Only after doing so
 * do wrapper functions forward calls to the next available function found by
 * `dlsym(3)` using `RTLD_NEXT`.
 *
 * PRE_CHECKPOINT:
 *   In this mode, `libmcmini.so` has been alerted about the end of the
 * recording session. Wrapper functions again forward their calls to the next
 * available function.
 *
 * TARGET_TEMPLATE_AFTER_RESTART:
 *   In this mode, `libmcmini.so` has been restored by `dmtcp_launch` from a
 * checkpoint image. Here, `libmcmini.so` will first attempt to communicate with
 * `mcmini` and transfer over the state information recorded during the RECORD
 * phase. After transfer has completed, `libmcmini.so` will behave the same as
 * `TARGET_TEMPLATE`.
 *
 * TARGET_BRANCH_AFTER_RESTART:
 *   In this mode, `mcmini` has signaled the restarted template process and
 * expects a new process to be created. Here, `libmcmini.so` must now have
 * wrapper functions behave as if under the control of the model checker as with
 * `TARGET_BRANCH`.
 *
 * DMTCP_RESTART:
 *   In this mode, the DMTCP plugin has been notified of the
 * `DMTCP_EVENT_RESTART` event. The user-space threads will transition into a
 * stable state before the template thread and the scheduler process proceed
 * with model checking.

 *
 * @note we CANNOT use a lock (at least easily) as e.g. during the
 * DMTCP_EVENT_RESTART event the user-space threads are blocked. This means that
 * using a lock to synchronize accesses to `libmcmini_mode` is dangerous: it's
 * possible that a user-space thread owned the lock at checkpoint-time (and
 * hence is also the owner at restart-time). If the checkpoint thread then tried
 * to acquire the lock, we'd have deadlock.
