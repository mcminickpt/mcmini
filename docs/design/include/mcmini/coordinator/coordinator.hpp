/**
 * @brief A mechanism which synchronizes a McMini model of a program
 * (`mcmini::model::program`) with a process executing that modeled program
 * (`mcmini::real_world::process`).
 *
 * Model-checking algorithms in McMini operate strictly on program models
 * (`mcmini::model::program`) and not directly with the raw memory contents of
 * a running process. McMini must work to continuously synchronize the _model_
 * it maintains of a program undergoing verification with the progression of the
 * _actual process_ whose state (i.e. memory) _is represented by_ that model.
 * Below is a schema of the synchronization the tracecoordinator performs.

 *
 * However, since McMini is an explicit-state model checker, a model can only be
 * constructed through the _execution_ of actual processes running in user space
 * (e.g. `fork()`-ed from a shell).
 *
 * Recall that a `mcmini::model::program` consists of a mapping between the
 * individual execution units of the program ("threads") and the next step that
 * thread will take once executed.
 *
 * A `mcmini::model::program`, among other things, must describe _how_ the model
 * in its current state can transition into a different state. But since _only_
 * the next immediate action (the "thread routine", e.g. `pthread_mutex_lock()`)
 * that will be taken by any thread `i` in that process is known _for
 * certain_ (all subsequent actions taken by any thread `i` are unknown), McMini
 * must coordinate changes in the process with changes in the model. After a
 * thread has executed its next immediate action in the process, its
 * the action that the thread will _later_ run (i.e. the subsequent action that
 * follows immediately after the given one) is discovered dynamically at
 * runtime. The diagram below illustrates the progre
